# Resonance Peak Detection with Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification

## Introduction
In this project, we explore the intricate world of particle physics with a focus on the measurement of the Z boson mass. Utilizing advanced techniques such as Bayesian neural networks and Monte Carlo Dropout, we aim to quantify the uncertainties inherent in such high-energy physics experiments. This project also emphasizes the analysis of data from CERN, providing insights into various particle interactions and decay processes.

## Technical Overview

### Particle Physics
Particle physics is the branch of physics that studies the nature of particles that constitute matter and radiation. It seeks to understand the fundamental constituents of matter and the forces acting between them.

### Z Boson Mass Measurement
The Z boson is an essential particle mediating the weak nuclear force, and precise measurement of its mass is critical for testing the Standard Model of particle physics. In this study, we utilize data analysis techniques and statistical methods to arrive at an accurate mass estimation.

### Bayesian Neural Networks
Bayesian neural networks incorporate Bayesian inference into neural network training, allowing the model to provide uncertainty estimates along with predictions. This aspect is particularly useful in areas where uncertainty quantification is crucial.

### Monte Carlo Dropout
Monte Carlo Dropout is a technique used in neural networks to estimate uncertainty by making multiple predictions with dropout applied during inference. This method generates a distribution of predictions, allowing for an assessment of the model's confidence in its outputs.

### Uncertainty Quantification
Uncertainty quantification involves the systematic study of uncertainties in computational and real-world systems. In this project, we apply various methods to quantify uncertainties in our Z boson mass measurements and the underlying assumptions of our models.

### CERN Data Analysis
CERN is home to some of the world's most complex particle physics experiments. Our project analyzes data from these experiments to extract meaningful insights and corroborate theoretical predictions.

## Conclusion
The integration of Bayesian methods and Monte Carlo techniques has the potential to enhance the measurement precision in particle physics. This project not only contributes to the scientific community but also sets the stage for future research in uncertainty quantification methodologies.
